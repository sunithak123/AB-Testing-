Title: A/B Testing for Fast-Food Promotion Effectiveness

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy (ANOVA & t-tests)

## Problem:

A fast-food chain tested three promotions to launch a new item. Weekly sales were tracked across 137 locations over four weeks. The goal was to determine which promotion maximized sales.

## Approach:

Cleaned and explored data on store age, location, market size, and weekly sales.

Visualized sales performance by promotion and market characteristics.

Conducted ANOVA and t-tests to determine statistically significant differences in mean sales.

 ## Key Insights:

Promotion 1 had significantly higher sales than Promotion 2.

No statistically significant difference between Promotion 1 and 3.

Recommendation: Discontinue Promotion 2; further test between 1 and 3.
